# Custom Devcontainer for codespaces âš¡

Custom container for github codespaces consists of installing some extensions like python, themes, live server etc to save time. 

Also includes installation of mongodb.


### Extensions Included
  ```
    "ms-python.python",
    "wakatime.vscode-wakatime",
    "akamud.vscode-theme-onedark",
    "github.copilot",
    "codezombiech.gitignore",
    "ms-toolsai.jupyter",
    "ms-toolsai.jupyter-keymap",
    "ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers",
    "ritwickdey.liveserver"
  ```
  
#### Future Goals : 
- [ ] Implementation to install latest mongodb version ( currently causes error and have to start and keep it open )
- [ ] Maybe cookiecutter version of this?
